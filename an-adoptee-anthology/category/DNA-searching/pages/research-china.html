          <p id="text"><a href="https://www.research-china.org/ora/index.htm">Research-China</a> is a Chinese-adoptee research and searching company owned by husband-wife duo Brian Stuy and Longlan Stuy. Both are well known in the Chinese-adoptee search circle. <br><br>
          They provide a number of finding services including looking for finding ads, birth parent search analysis, orphanage reliability analysis, and videos of finding place and town. <br><br>
          They are a great resource for birth parent finding as well as adoptees who just want to know a bit more about their birth place. Their services are great no matter where adoptees are in the searching process. They are particularly good for adoptees just starting out and are unsure where to begin. <br><br>
          They are also connected with another company that specializes in DNA matching between adoptees and potential birth parents in China. They have records of potential birth parents and their DNA samples in a database waiting for matches. <br><br>
          They also have a blog for adoptees to learn about searching as well as analysis reviews on a few searchers.</p>
