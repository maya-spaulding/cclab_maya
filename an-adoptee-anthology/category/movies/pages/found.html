          <p id="text"><span style="font-style: italic">Found</span> is a Netflix documentary about three Chinese-adoptees finding out that they are all realted to each other after taking a DNA test. With their newly discovered relatives, they all decided to search for their birth families and travled to China together with their adoptive families and searcher.<br><br>
          This documentary is very well made and presents the story in an unbiased way. With other documentary related to adoption and adoptees sometimes the audience can tell that the creators had an agenda. However, with this documentary, there did not feel like there was an underlying motivation. <br><br>
          With that said, be warned that this documentary is extremely emotional and may trigger adoptees due to the nature of the topics discussed and the scenes shown.</p>
