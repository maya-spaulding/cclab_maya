          <img id="bluebayou" src="../../../images/bluebayou-imdb.jpg">
          <p id="text"><span style="font-style: italic">Blue Bayou</span> is a film based on a true story about a Korean-adoptee-American at risk for deportation because his adoptive parents never filed for his citizenship.<br><br>
          This is in my collection, but I recommend not watching the film. This is because the film was created through explotation of a Korean-adoptee who has actually been deported back to South Korea. The producer, director and main actor Justin Chon took the adoptee's story and, against his wishes, turned the story into a Hollywood film. While Justin Chon has stated everything was done ethically, the adoptee has spoken on multiple platforms stating that Justin Chon did not have permission to tell his story. <br><br>
          Another issue I have with this film is that Justin Chon has spoken in an interview with <a style="font-style: italic" href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/blue-bayou-director-justin-chon-interview">TeenVogue</a> about whether or not the main character in the film would have benefited from not having his Korea culture erased. Justin Chon said yes and told a story about a Korean adoptee who was not supported in learning her Korean culture and how sad it was. While yes it bad that this adoptee was not supported, as a non-adoptee Justin Chon does not have the right to speak for the adoptee community because while some adoptees may benefit from knowing their birth culture, many adoptees do not wish to know their birth culture. So for Justin Chon to say a blanket statement shows ingorance and the spreading of misinformation which negatively affect the adoptee community while his movie profits.</p>
